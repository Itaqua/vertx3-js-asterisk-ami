Call Center Dashboard
=====================

Right now is just a chat room to show the realtime capabilities of React.js and Vertx.io

Build in less than 16hrs it uses React.js, ampersand.js, vertx.io, stylus, ES2015 (babel 6), gulp, todoist and webpack.

The project is developed using the [gitflow strategy](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/).

vertx.io picked up for speed (while in development may suck, it works well in production) and since is based on the JVM and can use JS as one of the languages and has A LOT of libraries.

A lot of things to do, security, persistence, etc.

How to run
----------

First install the dependencies:
npm install

(you may need to install gulp globally: npm install -g gulp)

then run: ./run.sh

it will build and run the app looking for changes on the "src" directory


yo need to "register" using your email (octavio.luna@gmail.com has a gravatar) and if the mail is associated with a gravatar you will see it at the top right (where you can later unregister)
